#### Start thinking

Minutes: 
* we need to fix on some small section to begin with
* the idea is new to the Gesture community, although not new with Deep Learning Community
* Vid2vid is a good start
* received access to redhen datasets

Actions: 
* if we can make vid2vid controllable, video anonymizer will be done
* check if such work already exists
* if not, read, summarize, run vid2vid
* pick 2 datasets and try running code on them
