title: How to anonymize audio?
---

The proposal stated 6 effects for anonymization: pitch, bass and treble, distortion, echo, reverb, and wah-wah effect

These are implemented for audacty. Although there exists a scripting API for audacity, the script requires audacity to be running in background. This condition is not favourable to us. 

Can these be done using some other python library? No. 
I have checked a lot of libraries on https://github.com/faroit/awesome-python-scientific-audio however, none of them supported something apart from pitch and noise. The python-audio-effects (https://github.com/carlthome/python-audio-effects)[pysndfx] supported all of them, but it does not work at all.

pysndfx is build on SoX, which has a wrapper https://pysox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example.html . 


Pitch: sox.pitch(n_semitones: float, quick: bool = False)

Treble: sox.treble(gain_db, frequency, slope)	
Bass: bass(gain_db, frequency, slope)	

Distortion: sox.overdrive(gain_db: float = 20.0, colour: float = 20.0)

Echo: sox.echo(gain_in, gain_out, n_echos, delays, decays)	
sox.echos(gain_in, gain_out, n_echos, delays, decays)	

Reverb: sox.reverb(reverberance, high_freq_damping, â€¦)
