title: Overview of DeepFake resources
---

In this post, I will state my approach for exploring Deep Fake. 

### Resource

There are several codes that replace faces in videos. 

The two most important resources:
* https://github.com/AliaksandrSiarohin/first-order-model
* https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab

There are several blogs that test their effectiveness. 
* https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-produce-a-deepfake-video-in-5-minutes-513984fd24b6
* https://jsoverson.medium.com/from-zero-to-deepfake-310551e59aa3
* https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/building-deep-fake-videos-cbdabc00e4c1

Right now, I tried the _first order model_. It was not working well on lab videos. I will think some more and update accordingly. 
Seeing the effectiveness of this code as tested by several blogs, I believe this will work. Just, I need to figure out what am I missing.
