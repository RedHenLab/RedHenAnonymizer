### Anonymizing AudioVisual Data 
#### with RedHen Labs

[The International Distributed Little Red Hen Labâ„¢](https://www.redhenlab.org/) is a global big data science laboratory and cooperative for research into multimodal communication. 

However, AudioVisual Data with RedHen is not shareable due to privacy reasons. Hence, using Audio Processing techniques, classical computer vision algorithms and recent Deep Learning algorithms we propose an anonymization engine for RedHen.
