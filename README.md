# Red Hen Anonymizer
Based on Yash Khasbage's GSOC-2021 Project with Red Hen Lab

The audio-visual data within Red Hen Lab is not freely shareable due to privacy issues. Hence, using audio processing methods, classical computer vision algorithm and deep learning techniques, we propose an anonymization engine. 

The final product is available as the RedHenAnonymizer (RHA) that can anonymize human faces and audio.
